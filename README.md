I recently worked on building a YouTube-inspired UI from scratch using HTML, CSS, and Google Material Icons. This project challenged me to focus on creating a clean, user-friendly design while sharpening my front-end development skills.

🔍 Key Features:
Fully responsive header with search, mic, and notification icons.
Sidebar navigation with interactive and hover effects.
Content area showcasing a dynamic video grid layout.
Material icons integration for a modern look.
This project allowed me to enhance my understanding of:
🎨 Responsive Design
🖌️ CSS Styling and Layouts
💡 Web Accessibility and User Experience
